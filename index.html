        <h2>Along Came a Spider</h2>
        A bite from a spider somehow granted teenager Peter Parker its arachnid abilities and instead of using them for personal gain, he decided to help others with them. An orphan living with his aunt, May Parker, the boy chose to wear a mask while fighting crime so as not to burden her with his actions.
        Calling himself Spider-Man and sporting a pair of web-shooting devices he'd constructed, Parker wound up in internet videos which attracted the attention of Tony Stark. The billionaire industrialist deduced Spider-Man's secret identity and approached Parker at his and May's home in Queens, New York with a request for aid from the hero in an upcoming confrontation with Captain America and a group of other rogue Avengers and associates. Parker was initially hesitant to even admit his secret career as Spider-Man, but the thrill of adventure and Stark's talk of responsibility drew him in and he accepted the invitation, as well as a new, high-tech costume and web-shooters.

        <h2>Key Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>He made his Marvel debut in 1962</h3></li>
                The web-slinging icon, who was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, first made his appearance in Marvel comics in August 1962. The comic was titled Amazing Fantasy #15 and original, mint-condition copies are worth over $1 million!
            <li><h3>Spider-Man was originally going to be an insect</h3></li>
                Stan Lee originally wanted to create a superhero based on an insect, but opted for a spider instead. And a Marvel hero was born.
            <li><h3>Spider-Man is hyphenated for a reason</h3></li>
                The reason Spider-Man is spelled with a hyphen is because Spidey creator and all-round legend Stan Lee didn't want people to get confused with Superman. So now you know.
            <li><h3>He's got loads of nicknames</h3></li>
                According to Marvel, you could call him... deep breath... Peter Benjamin Parker, Friendly Neighbourhood Spider-Man, The Amazing Spider-Man, The Sensational Spider-Man, The Spectacular Spider-Man, Tiger, Spidey, Webhead, Webslinger, Wall-crawler, Little Man, (formerly) The Amazing Octo-Spidey, Bag-Man, Bookworm, Captain Universe, Dusk, Hornet, Mad Dog #336, Man-Spider, Prodigy, Puny Parker, Ricochet, Scarlet Spider, Spider-Hulk. Or just Spidey.
            <li><h3>He studied physics at university</h3></li>
                Peter Parker knows lots about physics and has a BS in Physics and a doctoral studies in Biochemistry at ESU (Empire State University), which is "incomplete". It appears being busy fighting crime had an affect on his studies.
            <li><h3>He was born in New York City</h3></li>
                Spider-man - Peter Parker to his family - was born in Forest Hills, New York, which part of the borough of Queens!
            <li><h3>He's got lots of super powers</h3></li>
                According to the Marvel website, Spider-man possesses the following abilities: superhuman strength, superhuman speed, superhuman reflexes, superhuman durability and healing. All pretty handy when fighting crime.
            <li><h3>He's part of a few superhero teams</h3></li>
                When he's not swinging through the streets of New York City, Spider-man has also been part of Fantastic Four. He appeared alongside the gang in a four-part series - Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four - which was published in the summer of 2007!
            <li><h3>One President of the USA is a huge fan</h3></li>
                When it was revealed that President Barack Obama used to be a collector of Spider-man comics, he appeared the cover of The Amazing Spider-Man No. 583!
            <li><h3>He's almost 178 Beanos tall</h3></li>
                Spider-man stands at 5'10 tall and after some quick maths, that means he's the same height as 178 comics. That's almost three year's worth of your favourite weekly dose of laughs!
